# Bringing back emojis to emacs ðŸŒˆ

Due to [political reasons](http://www.lunaryorn.com/posts/bye-bye-emojis-emacs-hates-macos.html) the ability to show emojis in emacs have been [removed](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/commit/9344612d3cd164317170b6189ec43175757e4231?diff=unified). This formula patches emacs source to add them back.
